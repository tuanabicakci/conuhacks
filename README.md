## **Project Overview**  
MTLranked is a powerful data-driven tool designed to help newcomers to Montreal make informed decisions about where to live. By leveraging open-source municipal data and other key datasets, our model ranks neighborhoods based on essential factors like safety, economic opportunity, social inclusion, and environment.  

The project empowers users to filter and personalize their search for the perfect neighborhood using a custom-built index tailored to their needs.

## **Key Features**  
- **Comprehensive Neighborhood Index:** Factors such as safety, economic opportunity, and social inclusion are weighted to provide an insightful neighborhood ranking.  
- **User-Centric Filtering:** Users can prioritize categories that matter most to them and filter neighborhoods accordingly.  
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Streamlined data cleaning, calculation, and code refinement using advanced AI tools.  
- **Open Source Data Integration:** Built on data from Montreal's municipal sources and other datasets.
